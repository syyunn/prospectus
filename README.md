# Coarse-graining + Counterfactual queries

- General idea is to perform Coarsening over high-dimensional data, then proceed to counterfactual learning (based on normalizing-flow) on low-dim/hihg-level conceputal random variables.

# Transform Statistics and Normalizing Flows

- Core question is how to "transform" micro-state random variables to macro-state that well-defines cause of target behavior of the system?
